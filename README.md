Initial Readme file... its 10:18 am on 30/12/2022 and I have about 24h to finish this project that I just started. wish me luck.
...
It's 3 a.m. and I have less then 9 hours to submit my work, I am at the point where I don't think I can do any better at the moment. Tried to write as clean as I could and show as many aspects of what I have learned so far. The more I write and think the better I get and definitely know a lot more than I did last morning when I started this project. I really hope that I will pass ! My brain is shutting down and I hope I don't make a stupid mistake and get failed on technicality :/

<h2>Testing<h2>
    <ul>I go through multiple stages of testing and I check the code as soon as I am finished writing it and fixing the bugs straight away.</ul>
    <ul>Currently I am trying to figure out why my pictures and audio files that I have added to library don't work in my freshly published page.</ul>
    <ul>all files have been added to assets folder and worked through http.server but when I pushed everyhing to the github and published, they don't want to read them and show broken links</ul>
    <ul>I think that is the limitation of the github, I tried to reach out on slack, but it's 4 a.m. and normal people are sleeping</ul>

<h2>Validator Testing<h2>
    <ul>I have used both : HTML and CSS validator. There were a few bugs to start with but all of them have been solved and validators reported that there are not any issues.</ul>

<h2>Unfixed Bugs</h2>
    <ul>As stated previously there are broken links on the published pages. I don't know why. I have pushed all the files, all assets are updated and can be viewed through GitHub.</ul>

<h2>Deployment<h2>
    <ul>I have commited all the files and pushed them on to the repository. Have navigated through the GitHub pages and through the settings have published the pages.</ul>
    <ul>This is the site : https://mikemaroni9.github.io/Napoleon/index.html </ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
    <ul>Video media is linked from YouTube. Audio media was downloaded from youtube, sound exctraced and uploaded to asset folder</ul>
    <ul>Picture elements have been aquired through google search. Files have been download, some have been edited with MS.Paint</ul>
    <ul>Icons for the navigation toolbar has been taken from : https://fontawesome.com/ </ul>
    <ul>Code inspiration have been taken from code institute learning tools. Some things have been implemented from "Love Runnin" scenario.</ul>
    <ul>Bits and pieces did come from search engine, but mainly I searched how exactly to do something and then tried to add my twist to it. </ul>
