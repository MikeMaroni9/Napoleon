<h2>Testing<h2>
    <ul>I go through multiple stages of testing and I check the code as soon as I am finished writing it and fixing the bugs straight away.</ul>
    <ul>Currently I am trying to figure out why my pictures and audio files that I have added to library don't work in my freshly published page.</ul>
    <ul>all files have been added to assets folder and worked through http.server but when I pushed everyhing to the github and published, they don't want to read them and show broken links</ul>
    <ul>update 4:56 am, I found the reason why the pictures aren't showing. They were added as /assets/images/blala but I should have used assets/images/blabla</ul>
    <ul>I have used the screen sizes of 1200px and 950px to adjust the webpage to these platforms. It's not ideal but it work. Margins, widths etc have been adjusted.</ul>

<h2>Validator Testing<h2>
    <ul>I have used both : HTML and CSS validator. There were a few bugs to start with but all of them have been solved and validators reported that there are not any issues.</ul>
    <ul>Lighthouse Test</ul>
